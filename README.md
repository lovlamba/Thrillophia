# Thrillophia - A Travel wesite
<h4>Thrillophia is a travel website which highly interactive and user friendly. The main aim of the website is to provide information to the users regarding different tours available & knowing their interest in any of the tour. The user can request for brochure for any of the tour by simply filling up the form. The forms details will be stored in the database & can be accessed by admin . Admin can use user's contact details for sharing the brochure of respective tour externally. Funtionality of Sharing brochure has not been added in the project. The project is inspired from the famous travel site "Thrillophilia.com". I have chosen to build this project because i myself have used their site & services many times & i loved it. So when i learned the respective technologies , i decided to build a project on this domain.</h4>

## Technology Stack
### Frontend
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
### Backend
* Django
### DBMS
* SQLite3

## Folder Structure
In our repository, we have 4 folders & 2 files. Lets see the funtionality of them one by one :-
1. **Hello** - This is our main project folder. Its name is the Python package name you’ll need to use to import anything inside it (e.g. mysite.urls).These hello folder will further have some ".py" files which will play the following roles :-
    * **Hello/__init__.py:** An empty file that tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python package.
    * **Hello/asgi.py file**, new to Django as of version 3.0 which allows for an optional Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface to be run.ASGI can be considered as a succeeder   
    interface to the WSGI. It also has the work similar to WSGI but this is better than the previous one as it gives better freedom in Django development. That’s why WSGI is now   
    being increasingly replaced by ASGI.
    * **Hello/settings.py** file controls our project’s settings.As the name suggests this file stores the configurations or settings of our Django project, like database 
    configuration, main URL configurations, static file addresses, templating engines, security keys, allowed hosts, and much more.
    * **Hello/urls.py** tells Django which pages to present in response to a URL request.
    * **Hello/wsgi.py** , which stands for Web Server Gateway Interface, helps Django serve our eventual web pages means it is used for deploying our applications on to servers       like Apache etc.
2. **home** - This is our app folder. Django uses the concept of projects and apps to keep code clean and readable. A single Django project contains one or more apps within it that all work together to power a web application. For example, a real-world Django e-commerce site might have one app for user authentication, another app for payments, and a third app to power item listing details: each focuses on an isolated piece of functionality. That’s three distinct apps that all live within one top-level project.
This also contains several .py files :-
    * **_init_.py** : This file has the same functionality just as in the _init_.py file in the Django project structure. It remains empty and is present just to indicate that     the specific app directory is a package. No changes need to be made to the file manually.
    * **admin.py** : As the name suggests, this file is used for registering the models into the Django administration. The models that are present have a superuser/admin who   
    can control the information that is being stored. This admin interface is pre-built and we don’t need to create it.
    * **apps.py** : This file deals with the application configuration of the apps. The default configuration is sufficient enough in most of the cases and hence we won’t be   
    doing anything here in the beginning.
    * **models.py** : This file contains the models of our web applications (usually as classes). Models are basically the blueprints of the database we are using and hence    
    contain the information regarding attributes and the fields etc of the database.
    * **views.py** : This file is a crucial one, it contains all the Views(usually as classes). Views.py can be considered as a file that interacts with the client. Views are a     user interface for what we see when we render a Django Web application.
    * **urls.py** : Just like the project urls.py file, this file handles all the URLs of our web application. This file is just to link the Views in the app with the host web     URL. The settings urls.py has the endpoints corresponding to the Views.
    * **tests.py** : This file contains the code that contains different test cases for the application. It is used to test the working of the application.
3. **static** - The static folder contains all the images that we have used in our project. One can also include css in their static folder.
4. **templates** - In django, in order to provide frontend and provide a layout to our website, we use templates. It is basically written in HTML, CSS and Javascript in an .html file. We can have any number of templates depending on the requirement of our project. It is also fine to have none of them. But in our project we have used 6 html files to buld the website :-
    * **base.html** : This is the html file which has the basic or common layout that we have used in all pages . This include the **navbar** . For including the same navbar in     all pages, we have used **extend** tag.
    * **index.html** : This is the home page of our project which is build using **carousel** of three images.
    * **tours.html** : This page gives the short information about various tours & have a **request brochure** button which will take us to the form filling page           
    **contact.html**. For tours page we have used **albums** inside a **container** .
    * **contact.html** : Then we have contact page which is basically a form filling page in which we will have inputs such as name, email, whatsapp no., tour selection using radio buttons. This information will be saved in our database.
    * **about.html** : This is the page which will be showing information regarding Thrillophia. We have also used carousel in this page.
    * **reach.html** : In this page we will be sharing that how one can contact the admin. We have shared the contact details & the address of the admin.
 5. **db.sqlite3** - This is the default dbms provided by django. We can use other other dbms as well but for now, we will be using db.sqlite3 as our dbms. Here we will be storing the form data that the user entered to request brochure. we have also taking the date field here.
 6. **manage.py** - y A command-line utility that allows you to interact with your Django project. It is used to execute various Django commands such as running the local web server or creating a new app.

## Improvements in the future for the present system:
Many new features can be added on the website such as :
* Booking of Tours
* Online Payments
* A seperate page for each Tour
* Login for users
* Chatbot for user problems etc.
